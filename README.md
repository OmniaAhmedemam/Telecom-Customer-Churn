## Overview
Churn data for a fictional Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California, and includes details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status.
The primary goal of this project is is to understand the churn rate, and the primary factors which influence this statistic, and analysing the key indicators that increase churn risk. Based on these findings, I will provide recommendations to reduce churn rate and improve retention.
## Data source
The data includes information about each cutomer’s demographic, location, tenure, add-on services, and status, which can be found in greater detail at Maven Analytics.

## Software Tools
- Microsoft SQL Server (Data Cleaning, Data Exploration and Analysis)
- Power BI (Data Visualization)

## Insights
### 1- Customer
- Gender doesn’t strongly affect the churn rate.
- User with contacts will stay longer than those without contacts.
- 29% of churned customers are high value customers and 34% of stayed customers are high value customers.
- Customers who have referred fewer than 4 people have a higher probability of churning.
- Newly joined customers with less than 0.5 years of tenure are less stable and more likely to leave.

### 2- service
- Customers are more likely to churn when using Fiber Optic internet service, possibly due to poor connection quality or outdated resources.
- There is high probability for churn if customers choose month-to-month contract.
- Offering online security, online backup, device protection plans, and premium tech support may help retain customers.
- Short tenture time and choice of Offer E are the top risk drivers for churning.
- Offer A and Offer B are good ways to retain customers.
- More than half of customers in San Diego and Fallbrook left.
- A big proportion of paperless billing customers are churning.


## Recommendations
- ### Revamp promotional offers:
With "Competitors making better offers" being the top reason for churn, Maven needs to adapt its promotional offers. More than half of the customers do not have any offer, so increasing advertisement to increase awareness of offers would be helpful.
- ### Training Customer service:
12% of customers who left did so due to dissatisfaction of support staff attitude. Maven could provide additional training for support staff to improve customer satisfaction.
- ### Improve Fiber Optic Service:
Customers using Fiber Optic service have a high potential to leave, possibly due to service or device issues, as well as the higher price compared to other internet types.
- ### Engage High-Value Customers:
 Maven needs to keep these customers from leaving through various ways, such as providing free add-on services with high retention rates like online security/online backup/device protection plan/premium tech support.
